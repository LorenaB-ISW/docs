# Product Overview

## What is Simba Intelligence?

Simba Intelligence is an **AI-powered data platform** that transforms how organizations access and analyze their data. Instead of requiring technical expertise to write complex SQL queries or navigate multiple data systems, Simba Intelligence allows users to ask questions in plain English and get instant, intelligent answers from their data sources.

Think of Simba Intelligence as having a knowledgeable data analyst on your team who can:

- Instantly understand what data you need based on natural language descriptions
- Automatically connect to and configure your databases
- Query multiple data sources simultaneously
- Provide answers in the format that makes the most sense for your question

## Core Problems Solved

**🔍 Data Discovery Complexity**\
Organizations struggle to find and connect the right data sources for analysis. Simba Intelligence uses AI agents to automatically discover, understand, and configure data connections based on simple descriptions or even screenshots of desired dashboards.

**💬 Technical Barriers to Data Access**\
Business users often depend on technical teams to write queries and generate reports. With natural language querying, anyone can ask data questions directly: _"What were our top-selling products in Q3?"_ or _"Show me customer churn trends by region."_

**🔗 Data Silos and Integration Challenges**\
Data scattered across SQL Server, PostgreSQL, Snowflake, and other systems creates integration headaches. Simba Intelligence provides federated querying that works across all your data sources without requiring data movement.

**⏱️ Slow Time-to-Insight**\
Traditional BI tools require extensive setup and maintenance. Simba Intelligence delivers immediate insights through AI-powered analysis and intelligent caching that learns from usage patterns.
